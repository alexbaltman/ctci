'''
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Give two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

Example:
    pale, ple --> True
    pales, pale
    pale, bale
    pale, bake --> False
Hints: 23, 97, 130
