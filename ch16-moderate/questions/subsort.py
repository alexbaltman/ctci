'''
Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices m and n such that if you sorted elements m through n, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize n - m (that is, find the smallest such sequence).

Example:
    Input: 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19
    Output: (3, 9)

Hints: 482, 553, 667, 708, 735, 746
