'''
A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. Given a binry search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.

Example:
    Input: 2 points at 1 and 3 as children
    Output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}

Hints: 39, 48, 66, 82
