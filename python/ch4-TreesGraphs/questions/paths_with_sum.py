'''
You are given a binary search tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

Hints: 6, 14, 52, 68, 77, 87, 94, 103, 108, 115
