'''
You are given an array like data structure Listy which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason the data strucutre only supports positive integers.) Give a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times you may return any index.
