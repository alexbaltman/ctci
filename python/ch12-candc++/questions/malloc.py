'''
Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such that the memory address returned is divisible by a specific power of two.

Example:
    Input: align_malloc(1000, 128)
    Output: will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128 and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.
    Input: aligned_free()
    Output: will free memory allocated by align_malloc
