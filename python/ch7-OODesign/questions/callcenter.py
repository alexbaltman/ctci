Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manger. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.
