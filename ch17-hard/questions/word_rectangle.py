'''
Given a list of millions of words, design an algorithm to create the largest possible rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading from top to bottom). The words need to be chosen consecutively from the list, but all rows must be the same length and all columns must be the same height.

Hints: 477, 500, 748
