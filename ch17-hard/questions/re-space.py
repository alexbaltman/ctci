Oh, no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, puncuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" became "iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot". You'll deal with the punctuation and capitalization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string), design an algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters.

Example:
    Input: jesslookedjustliketimherbrother
    Output: jess looked just like tim her brother (7 unrecognized characters)

Hints: 496, 623, 656, 677, 739, 749
