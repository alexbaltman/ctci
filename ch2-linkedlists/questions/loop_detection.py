'''
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

Definition:
    Circulr linked list: A (corupt) linked list, in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to mkae a loop in the linked list.

Example:
    Input: A->B->C->D->E->C [the same as earlier]
    Output: C

Hints: 50, 69, 83, 90
